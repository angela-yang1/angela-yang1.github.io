        <h2>Sprint 2 - Learning Plan</h2>
        <p class="task">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
            <p>My long term goal and career plan is to work in the tech industry as a developer (and also complete my degree)</p>
        <p class="task">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</p>
            <p>I would like to develop more confidence in myself and my work â€“ doubt myself less and be more confident in who I am and what I can do</p>
        <p class="task">A description of your own strengths and limitations</p>
            <p>My strengths are that I am hard-working and results-focussed, given a goal or task I will always try to go above and beyond.</p>
            <p>My limitations are that sometimes I can be a perfectionist, be too hard on myself and also relying on myself too much. For example sometimes not asking for help or spending too much time trying to perfect something.</p>
        <p class="task">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p>
            <p>I will aim to prioritise the main tasks at hand and try not to spend too much time on the minor details. I will proactively seek help or advice from facilitators or other learners if I am unsure of anything</p>
        <p class="task">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p>
            <p>If I am stuck or unsure about something and required to ask for help, I will aim to seek help well ahead of time to be able to meet the due dates</p>
        <p class="task">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</p>
            <p>To be approachable and supportive. Offer guidance and honest advice on my progression, or things I could improve on to help with my development.</p>
        <p class="task">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</p>
            <p>I aim to schedule in time during the weekday evenings and both weekend days, due to work commitments.</p>
