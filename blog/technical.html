      <h3>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h3>
      <h4>10 November 2010</h4>
      <p>Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.</p>
      <p>Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.</p>
      <p>While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.</p>

        <p class="task">Overview of the id Selector:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use # to identify id's in a CSS file</li>
        <li>IDs are unique</li>
        <li>Uses the id attribute of an HTML element e.g. id="name"</li>
        <li>Each element in HTML can have only one ID</li>
        <li>Each page can have only one element with that ID</li>
        <li>When you want to select something specific</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="task">Overview of the class Selector:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use . dot to identify classes in a CSS file</li>
        <li>Classes are not unique</li>
        <li>Use the same class on multiple elements</li>
        <li>Use multiple classes on the same element</li>
        <li>Styling information that needs to be applied to multiple objects on a page should be done with a class</li>
        <li>Used to apply the same set of styling</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="fig">Fig 2. Example of the class selector</p></br>
      <p class="task">What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</p>
      <p>Use a class when you want to consistently style multiple elements – it is good for when you have more than one element on your page that shares the same style e.g. body text. A given element can also have more than one class associated to it, whereas an id you can only have one.</p>
      <p>Use the id selector when there is only one single element on the page that will use the style - it is good for using on “main” page content such as headings or titles.</p>

      </h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="task">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</p>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of web pages - this can include text, images or videos. While CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds the styling to the HTML elements.</p>
        <p>For example – HTML contains the structure of the page which could be like the structure of a building.</p>
        <p>A CSS file contains the styling of the page, it allows you to use different colours, positioning etc. This would be the design of the house.</p></br>
        <p class="task">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</p>
        <p>Control flow is the order of which your code will execute – usually starting from the top to bottom until it reaches the end. Loops are used when you want to do an action a number of times repeatedly. The loop will stop when it meets the exit condition.</p>
        <p>For example, walking – move your right and left leg until you reach our destination or ticking off your list at the supermarket – you go home when all the items are ticked off.</p></br>
        <p class="task">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</p>
        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML. You can access it with Developer Tools (DevTools), it represents (as nodes and objects) the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. A web page is a document, which can be display in the browser or HTML source code – the DOM represents that same document so it can be manipulated/modified (an object orientated representation of the web page) with a scripting language e.g. Javascript.</p></br>
        <p class="task">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</p>
        <p>With arrays you use bracket notation to access data in the array using the index, whereas objects, you can use bracket and dot notation and the data is accessed using the key.</p></br>
        <p class="task">Explain what functions are and why they are useful</p>
        <p>A function is a block of code with a set of commands. The function is executed to perform a certain task when it is called upon. In Javascript, a function is defined using the keyword ‘function’ followed by a name and parenthesis (), which may contain parameters inside. When the function reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.</p>
        <p>Functions are useful as you can reuse code, you define it once and it can be used many times with different arguments to execute different results.</p>
