      <h3>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h3>
      <h4>10 November 2010</h4>
      <p>Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.</p>
      <p>Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.</p>
      <p>While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.</p>

        <p class="task">Overview of the id Selector:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use # to identify id's in a CSS file</li>
        <li>IDs are unique</li>
        <li>Uses the id attribute of an HTML element e.g. id="name"</li>
        <li>Each element in HTML can have only one ID</li>
        <li>Each page can have only one element with that ID</li>
        <li>When you want to select something specific</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="task">Overview of the class Selector:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use . dot to identify classes in a CSS file</li>
        <li>Classes are not unique</li>
        <li>Use the same class on multiple elements</li>
        <li>Use multiple classes on the same element</li>
        <li>Styling information that needs to be applied to multiple objects on a page should be done with a class</li>
        <li>Used to apply the same set of styling</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="fig">Fig 2. Example of the class selector</p></br>
      <p class="task">What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</p>
      <p>Use a class when you want to consistently style multiple elements – it is good for when you have more than one element on your page that shares the same style e.g. body text. A given element can also have more than one class associated to it, whereas an id you can only have one.</p>
      <p>Use the id selector when there is only one single element on the page that will use the style - it is good for using on “main” page content such as headings or titles.</p>

      </h2>
      <div class="content">
        <p class="task">An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</p>
        <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of web pages - this can include text, images or videos. While CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) adds the styling to the HTML elements.</p>
        <p>For example – HTML contains the structure of the page which could be like the structure of a building.</p>
        <p>A CSS file contains the styling of the page, it allows you to use different colours, positioning etc. This would be the design of the house.</p></br>
        <p class="task">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</p>
        <p>Control flow is the order of which your code will execute – usually starting from the top to bottom until it reaches the end. Loops are used when you want to do an action a number of times repeatedly. The loop will stop when it meets the exit condition.</p>
        <p>For example, walking – move your right and left leg until you reach our destination or ticking off your list at the supermarket – you go home when all the items are ticked off.</p></br>
        <p class="task">Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it</p>
        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML. You can access it with Developer Tools (DevTools), it represents (as nodes and objects) the page so that programs can change the document structure, style and content. A web page is a document, which can be display in the browser or HTML source code – the DOM represents that same document so it can be manipulated/modified (an object orientated representation of the web page) with a scripting language e.g. Javascript.</p></br>
        <p class="task">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</p>
        <p>With arrays you use bracket notation to access data in the array using the index, whereas objects, you can use bracket and dot notation and the data is accessed using the key.</p></br>
        <p class="task">Explain what functions are and why they are useful</p>
        <p>A function is a block of code with a set of commands. The function is executed to perform a certain task when it is called upon. In Javascript, a function is defined using the keyword ‘function’ followed by a name and parenthesis (), which may contain parameters inside. When the function reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.</p>
        <p>Functions are useful as you can reuse code, you define it once and it can be used many times with different arguments to execute different results.</p>

        </h2>
        <div class="content">
          <p class="task">Getting blocked on a simple problem</p>
          <p>I got stuck with how to push changes to my Github for Sprint 1 (while trying to stick with timebox suggestions). This was the last step of the process to push all the changes you’ve made from your local computer to Github. I knew it was such a simple and easy step but for some reason I was stuck.</p>
          <p>I researched (Googled) and watched videos (resources provided) on how to merge/delete the branch and push changes to Github multiple times. I was feeling quite frustrated as I knew that it was such a simple task and not complicated at all, but I was stuck on it for almost double the timebox suggestion times.</p>
          <p>I learnt that sometimes I should slow down a bit and not get too ahead, as sometimes you can miss things.</p></br>
          <p class="task">Solved a problem in an elegant way</p>
          <p>In the Built-In Methods challenge, I felt that my code was a bit long and complicated to read (spanning over several lines of code). I used Javascript ES6 syntax to refactor my code to be more simpler and readable. ES6 introduces new syntax and features to make code more modern and readable.</p>
          <p>The problem solving techniques I used were googling and pseudocode.</p>
          <p>I felt frustrated at times but accomplished when I solved the challenge. I learnt that there are always better ways to solving the problem.</p></br></br>
          <p class="task">Reflect on Problem Solving Techniques</p>
          <p>The most common problem-solving techniques I have been using are Pseudocode and Googling which is then followed by trying something. I feel quite confident using the other techniques such as asking for peers and coaches for help but as I am doing it remotely it’s not as quick as I’d like to get a response. I do, however ask others I know who are familiar with coding on their help and input.</p>
          <p>Depending on the task or challenge, I also often will use reading error messages and console.logging (however, these can take a lot of time and can be confusing if the error messages are unclear). The error messages can be helpful though, if it states clearly which line of code is throwing the error – this would usually result in a Google search and again, followed by trying something.</p>
          <p>The other two techniques, rubber ducky method and improving with reflection, is something I can work on and use more. These two techniques I had not previously used very much, especially the rubber ducky so perhaps going forward, I should try using these techniques first above all.</p>
