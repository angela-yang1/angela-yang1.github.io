            <h2>Sprint 1: Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h2>
            <p class="task">Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</p>
                <p>Personal Values: Honesty, kindness, integrity, dependability, determination</p>
                <p>I see myself as an honest and dependable person, I work-hard and take pride in everything I do. I want to be able to be relied on, whether that’s with family/friends or in the workplace and I tend to not want to let people down, which I guess is why I often put others first before myself.</p>
                <p>Though I believe in kindness and fairness – I also believe in being honest and saying the truth. If I feel that something isn’t right – I won’t hesitate to speak the truth, though being a shy person that can be a challenge sometimes!</p>
            <p class="task">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
                <p>I work in an environment where opinions and views are strong, that processes and the way of working must be a certain way, as they say it’s the way it’s always been. Though, I highly respect my colleagues and peers, on occasions I have had to question why things are done the way they are, as I have not 100% agreed on their methodology. The responses weren’t always positive, however I tried to ask in a respectful way, and in a way that I was trying to understand things from their perspective. With a bit of discussion and understanding from both sides, eventually the outcome was positive.</p>
            <p class="task">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
                <p>Having grown up in NZ – I haven’t had a lot of exposure to my Chinese culture. Though growing up I have always been taught the value of family, to work hard, aim high, be grateful for what you have and build a great future for myself. Taking our first trip to my family’s hometown in China, when I was around 14 was eye-opening as I had only ever heard childhood stories from my mum. At first, it was a bit of a culture shock as it was very different from NZ but soon, I learned to love every moment. I saw first-hand all the great things I was being taught growing up and how important each and every one of them were. Thus, shaping me into the person I am today and how I see the world.</p>
        
            <p class="task">Gather evidence to identify your strengths and areas for development. Evidence might include: personality or skills/capability assessment tools like Myers Briggs, Strengthsfinder; DOPE; Capability Sort; Minded; task 1 examples.</p>
                <p>After completing some research and taking the personality tests – I came out with The Logistician ISTJ personality type and the Owl. Some main highlights I’ve taken is that people with the Logistician personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions and take pride in the work they do. Meanwhile, the Owl is seen as logical, a perfectionist and not big risk takers but love detail.</p>
            <p class="task">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
            <p class="task">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
            <p class="task">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
                <p>These are some of the traits that I see as my strengths and limitations which will shape my learning and career development. Some of my other strengths include being results-focussed, reliable and honest. Being results-focussed, this will push and motivate me to my end-goal, which is to have a great career. However, as mentioned above I can be a perfectionist and sometimes even impatient, which I see as a limitation. I often can be slower to make decisions or spend too much time on something as I need to be 110% sure of the choice first. This could defer me from the smaller to more important tasks.</p>
            <p class="task">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
                <p>I worked with someone who was very strong-willed and wanted to have control over everything. There were a couple of disagreements and comments made about what work I should or shouldn’t be doing. Obviously, this did not sit well with me as they were a peer and I saw it as a limitation in terms of my development. At the time I wasn’t in the right state of mind or felt comfortable with confrontation even though I knew I should’ve and wanted to, this ultimately ended up being an unhappy workplace and in hindsight, what I would’ve done now is confront the person and been more confident in myself at the time.</p>

            <h2>Sprint 2: Learning Plan</h2>
            <p class="task">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
                <p>My long term goal and career plan is to work in the tech industry as a developer (and also complete my degree)</p>
            <p class="task">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</p>
                <p>I would like to develop more confidence in myself and my work – doubt myself less and be more confident in who I am and what I can do</p>
            <p class="task">A description of your own strengths and limitations</p>
                <p>My strengths are that I am hard-working and results-focussed, given a goal or task I will always try to go above and beyond.</p>
                <p>My limitations are that sometimes I can be a perfectionist, be too hard on myself and also relying on myself too much. For example sometimes not asking for help or spending too much time trying to perfect something.</p>
            <p class="task">Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p>
                <p>I will aim to prioritise the main tasks at hand and try not to spend too much time on the minor details. I will proactively seek help or advice from facilitators or other learners if I am unsure of anything</p>
            <p class="task">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</p>
                <p>If I am stuck or unsure about something and required to ask for help, I will aim to seek help well ahead of time to be able to meet the due dates</p>
            <p class="task">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</p>
                <p>To be approachable and supportive. Offer guidance and honest advice on my progression, or things I could improve on to help with my development.</p>
            <p class="task">Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</p>
                <p>I aim to schedule in time during the weekday evenings and both weekend days, due to work commitments.</p>
