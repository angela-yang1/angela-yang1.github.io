          </h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p class="task">Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</p>
            <p>Personal Values: Honesty, kindness, integrity, dependability, determination</p>
            <p>I see myself as an honest and dependable person, I work-hard and take pride in everything I do. I want to be able to be relied on, whether that’s with family/friends or in the workplace and I tend to not want to let people down, which I guess is why I often put others first before myself.</p>
            <p>Though I believe in kindness and fairness – I also believe in being honest and saying the truth. If I feel that something isn’t right – I won’t hesitate to speak the truth, though being a shy person that can be a challenge sometimes!</p>
        <p class="task">Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</p>
            <p>I work in an environment where opinions and views are strong, that processes and the way of working must be a certain way, as they say it’s the way it’s always been. Though, I highly respect my colleagues and peers, on occasions I have had to question why things are done the way they are, as I have not 100% agreed on their methodology. The responses weren’t always positive, however I tried to ask in a respectful way, and in a way that I was trying to understand things from their perspective. With a bit of discussion and understanding from both sides, eventually the outcome was positive.</p>
        <p class="task">Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</p>
            <p>Having grown up in NZ – I haven’t had a lot of exposure to my Chinese culture. Though growing up I have always been taught the value of family, to work hard, aim high, be grateful for what you have and build a great future for myself. Taking our first trip to my family’s hometown in China, when I was around 14 was eye-opening as I had only ever heard childhood stories from my mum. At first, it was a bit of a culture shock as it was very different from NZ but soon, I learned to love every moment. I saw first-hand all the great things I was being taught growing up and how important each and every one of them were. Thus, shaping me into the person I am today and how I see the world.</p>
    
        <p class="task">Gather evidence to identify your strengths and areas for development. Evidence might include: personality or skills/capability assessment tools like Myers Briggs, Strengthsfinder; DOPE; Capability Sort; Minded; task 1 examples.</p>
            <p>After completing some research and taking the personality tests – I came out with The Logistician ISTJ personality type and the Owl. Some main highlights I’ve taken is that people with the Logistician personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions and take pride in the work they do. Meanwhile, the Owl is seen as logical, a perfectionist and not big risk takers but love detail.</p>
        <p class="task">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
        <p class="task">Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
        <p class="task">Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
            <p>These are some of the traits that I see as my strengths and limitations which will shape my learning and career development. Some of my other strengths include being results-focussed, reliable and honest. Being results-focussed, this will push and motivate me to my end-goal, which is to have a great career. However, as mentioned above I can be a perfectionist and sometimes even impatient, which I see as a limitation. I often can be slower to make decisions or spend too much time on something as I need to be 110% sure of the choice first. This could defer me from the smaller to more important tasks.</p>
        <p class="task">Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
            <p>I worked with someone who was very strong-willed and wanted to have control over everything. There were a couple of disagreements and comments made about what work I should or shouldn’t be doing. Obviously, this did not sit well with me as they were a peer and I saw it as a limitation in terms of my development. At the time I wasn’t in the right state of mind or felt comfortable with confrontation even though I knew I should’ve and wanted to, this ultimately ended up being an unhappy workplace and in hindsight, what I would’ve done now is confront the person and been more confident in myself at the time.</p>

          </h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>My long term goal and career plan is to build a career in the tech industry as a developer (and also complete my degree). This is something that I have been working towards for a little while now and would love nothing more than to reach that goal. At EDA, I would like to develop more confidence in myself and my work – doubt myself less and be more confident in who I am and what I can do.</p>
            <p>My strengths that will help me thrive in this programme include, having high attention to detail, being a fast-learner and results-focussed. My limitations and challenges are that sometimes I can be a perfectionist, be too hard on myself and also relying on myself too much. For example sometimes not asking for help or spending too much time trying to perfect something.</p>
            <p>I will prioritise the main tasks at hand and try not to spend too much time on the minor details. I will proactively seek help or advice from facilitators or other learners if I am unsure of anything. I will ensure this is done in a timely manner and ahead of time, to ensure meeting due dates.</p>
            <p>My expectations of the facilitation team are to be approachable and supportive. Such as offer guidance and honest advice on my progression, or things I could improve on to help with my development.</p>
            <p>During my time completing Foundations, I will schedule time during the evenings in the week and the weekends, due to work commitments.</p>

          </h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Emotional Intelligence is being able to identify emotions in ourselves and others, the ability to monitor your own and other’s emotions. To distinguish between and label different emotions correctly. To use this as a guide to your thinking and behaviour. How we relate and communicate with others, such as empathising or having a meaningful conversation.</p>
            <p>IQ (Intelligence Quotient) refers to the measure of an individuals’ academic abilities and intelligence level. The ability to learn, understand knowledge, logical reasoning and abstract thinking. For example, a person’s academic success depends on their IQ level, whereas a person’s EQ level is more about their success in life. Generally speaking, IQ is usually an ability that a person is born with, while EQ can always be improved.</p>
            <p>While IQ is still seen and recognised as an important element of success, EQ is important for self-improvement and has a lot of positive benefits. Being more aware of people and emotion can help to improve your happiness, performance and leadership. This usually includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social skills.</p>

            </h2>
            <div class="content">
            <p class="task">NEUROPLASTICITY</p></br>
            <p class="task">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</p>
              <p>Our thoughts determine the structure of our brain and the way we think about ourselves. Understanding neuroplasticity and the possibilities of the brain hugely benefit’s us, as a person’s thoughts drives their actions. If we believe that we can grow and learn new things then we can. Recognising that our brains can change and believing that It’s possible, puts you into the right mindset that you can grow, learn and establish better habits which could contribute to a person’s well-being, health and success.</p>
            <p class="task">Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</p> 
              <p>Repetition and practice, such as writing code – with more repetition and practice I will get better at it, and be able to keep learning as I progress.</p>
            <p class="task">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</p>
              <p>Quality sleep – the brain needs sleep to reset and is important for memory and learning. Lack of sleep can impair a person’s memory.</p>
              <p>Learning and practicing – learning has been found to strengthen the brain, like the body with exercise.</p>
              <p>Setting a goal – finding something to work towards can motivate your learning, and therefore enhancing neuroplasticity.</p></br>
            <p class="task">GROWTH MINDSET</p></br>
            <p class="task">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</p>
            <p>Having a growth mindset means that you believe your intelligence and talents can be developed. This leads to having a desire to learn, take on new challenges, being acceptive to criticism and learning from it. Having a growth mindset is relevant as we now live in an everchanging world where technology and change is the norm. Where there is change, there is learning and that is where having a growth mindset comes in.</p>
            <p class="task">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</p>
            <p>Nothing that I didn’t already recognise in myself. I recognise that sometimes I can have a fixed mindset - there are times where I don’t believe in myself and that I can do something (for example, Maths or learning to code). Coming into the topics for this Core blog has made me realise more that it’s something I should keep trying to improve myself on, part of that is choosing to study at Dev Academy.</p>
            <p class="task">How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</p>
            <p>I think I'm already half way there by starting my uni degree and studying at Dev Academy! With each paper or assignment completed, I believed my abilities more and more. I was always open to change and learning more efficient ways of doing things at work but for a while I was convinced that personally I couldn’t develop myself much more. Now coming into this course, I will keep pushing myself to do better and steer away any negativity that I can’t learn or grow.</p>
            <p class="task">Blend with your learning plan and strategies - Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</p>
            <p>Reading and researching these topics has shown me more that anything is possible, or that you can achieve anything if you set your mind to it. During this journey, I intend to work on my self-belief and confidence, as I see that as my biggest limitation. I would also like to gain feedback and see what areas I can improve on.</p>
